# Predict-Direction-of-Penalty-Using-Deep-Learning
Revolutionizing Football Analysis: A Deep Learning Approch to Predict the direction of Penalty in FootballÂ¶
The main aim of this project is to predict the direction of penalty shot in Football using pre-trained Deep Learning models and Image frames just before penalty shot has been taken. In this notebook InceptionV3 pre-trained deep learning model has been utilized. The images that are used for training the model has been taken out from penalty shoot videos. The images are classified into 5 categories based on the direction of the shot. The classes are Centre, Left_lower, Left_upper, Right_lower, Right_upper.

In this notebook step by step implementation of this project has been depicted.
